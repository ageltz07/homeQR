# README

Currently writing this app so that I and eventually other users can create printable 
QR codes that link to a list of  items available at their events. 
Example being what food/drinks are available at your cookout this weekend

I had this idea after having a July 4th cookout at my house and found it would
be much easier to have a few QR codes sprinkled around inside and outside with
what drinks are available. Much better than me telling each of my guests a list of drinks
in the coolers/fridge or what all will be made on the grill.

Features to be added
- User Sign Up
- Creation of Events and attaching items (Food/Drinks) and images for each item
- Ability to update the list to show which items are still available
- More to come...
